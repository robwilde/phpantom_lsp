//! Diagnostics — collect and deliver LSP diagnostics for PHP files.
//!
//! This module collects diagnostics from multiple providers and delivers
//! them to the editor.  Two delivery models are supported:
//!
//! - **Pull model** (`textDocument/diagnostic`, LSP 3.17) — the editor
//!   requests diagnostics when it needs them.  Only visible files are
//!   diagnosed.  Cross-file invalidation uses `workspace/diagnostic/refresh`.
//!   This is the preferred model when the client supports it.
//!
//! - **Push model** (`textDocument/publishDiagnostics`) — the server
//!   pushes diagnostics after every edit.  Used as a fallback for clients
//!   that do not advertise pull-diagnostic support.
//!
//! Providers are grouped into three phases so that cheap results appear
//! immediately and expensive external tools never block native feedback:
//!
//! ## Phase 1 — fast (no type resolution)
//!
//! - **Syntax error diagnostics** — surface parse errors from the Mago
//!   parser as Error-severity diagnostics.  The most fundamental
//!   diagnostic: without it, a user with a typo gets no feedback until
//!   they try to run the code.
//! - **`@deprecated` usage diagnostics** — report references to symbols
//!   marked `@deprecated` with `DiagnosticTag::Deprecated` (renders as
//!   strikethrough in most editors).
//! - **Unused `use` dimming** — dim `use` declarations that are not
//!   referenced anywhere in the file with `DiagnosticTag::Unnecessary`.
//!
//! ## Phase 2 — slow (require type resolution)
//!
//! - **Unknown class diagnostics** — report `ClassReference` spans that
//!   cannot be resolved through any resolution phase (use-map, local
//!   classes, same-namespace, class_index, classmap, PSR-4, stubs).
//! - **Unknown member diagnostics** — report `MemberAccess` spans where
//!   the member does not exist on the resolved class after full
//!   resolution (inheritance + virtual member providers).  Suppressed
//!   when the class has `__call` / `__callStatic` / `__get` magic methods.
//! - **Unknown function diagnostics** — report function calls that
//!   cannot be resolved to any known function definition.
//! - **Unresolved member access diagnostics** (opt-in) — report
//!   `MemberAccess` spans where the **subject type** cannot be resolved
//!   at all.  Off by default; enable via `[diagnostics]
//!   unresolved-member-access = true` in `.phpantom.toml`.  Uses
//!   `Severity::HINT` to surface type-coverage gaps without drowning
//!   the editor in warnings.
//! - **Argument count diagnostics** — report calls where the number of
//!   arguments does not match the function/method signature.
//! - **Implementation error diagnostics** — report concrete classes that
//!   fail to implement all required methods from their interfaces or
//!   abstract parents.  Reuses the same missing-method detection as the
//!   "Implement missing methods" code action.
//!
//! ## Phase 3 — heavy (external process, dedicated worker)
//!
//! - **PHPStan proxy diagnostics** — run PHPStan in editor mode
//!   (`--tmp-file` / `--instead-of`) and surface its errors as LSP
//!   diagnostics.  Auto-detected via `vendor/bin/phpstan` or `$PATH`;
//!   configurable in `.phpantom.toml` under `[phpstan]`.
//!
//!   PHPStan runs in a **dedicated worker task**, separate from the
//!   main diagnostic worker, because it is extremely slow and
//!   resource-intensive.  At most one PHPStan process runs at a time.
//!   If edits arrive while PHPStan is running, the pending URI is
//!   updated and the worker picks it up after the current run finishes.
//!   Native diagnostics (phases 1 and 2) are never blocked.
//!
//! ## Publishing strategy
//!
//! Fast diagnostics are **always pushed** immediately via
//! `textDocument/publishDiagnostics`, merged with cached slow and
//! PHPStan results so the editor never shows a gap.  This gives
//! instant feedback (strikethrough, dimming) regardless of client
//! capabilities.
//!
//! Slow diagnostics are then computed by the background worker:
//!
//! - **Pull mode** — the worker caches the full result (fast + fresh
//!   slow + cached PHPStan) and sends `workspace/diagnostic/refresh`.
//!   The editor re-pulls and gets the complete set.  No second push
//!   is needed.
//!
//! - **Push mode** (fallback) — the worker pushes the full result
//!   (fast + fresh slow + cached PHPStan) via `publishDiagnostics`,
//!   replacing the Phase 1 snapshot.
//!
//! - **PHPStan worker** — caches its results and triggers a re-deliver
//!   (refresh in pull mode, full re-publish in push mode).
//!
//! Diagnostics are published **asynchronously** via [`Backend::schedule_diagnostics`].
//! On every `did_change` event a version counter is bumped and the
//! diagnostic worker is notified.  The worker debounces rapid edits
//! (waits [`DIAGNOSTIC_DEBOUNCE_MS`] after the last notification) and
//! then runs a single diagnostic pass.  At most one pass runs at a time;
//! if new edits arrive while a pass is in flight, a single follow-up
//! pass is scheduled once the current one finishes.  This two-slot
//! design (one running, one pending) ensures diagnostics never block
//! completion, hover, or other latency-sensitive requests.
