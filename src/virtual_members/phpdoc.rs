//! PHPDoc virtual member provider.
//!
//! Extracts `@method`, `@property` / `@property-read` / `@property-write`,
//! and `@mixin` tags from the class-level docblock and presents them as
//! virtual members.  This is the second-highest-priority virtual member
//! provider: framework providers (e.g. Laravel) take precedence, but
//! PHPDoc-sourced members beat all other virtual member sources.
//!
//! Within this provider, `@method` and `@property` tags take precedence
//! over `@mixin` members: if a class declares both `@property int $id`
//! and `@mixin SomeClass` where `SomeClass` also has an `$id` property,
//! the `@property` tag wins.
//!
//! Previously `@method` / `@property` and `@mixin` were handled by two
//! separate providers (`PHPDocProvider` and `MixinProvider`).  Since both
//! are driven by PHPDoc tags, they are now unified into a single provider
//! with internal precedence rules.
