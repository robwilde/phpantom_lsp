# PHPantom — Roadmap

This is the master index for all planned work. Each row links to the
domain document that contains the full specification. Items are
sequenced by **sprint priority** — what to build next to widen the type
intelligence lead, then close the LSP feature gap, maximising coverage
with each step.

| Label      | Scale                                                                                                                  |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Impact** | **Critical**, **High**, **Medium-High**, **Medium**, **Low-Medium**, **Low**                                           |
| **Effort** | **Low** (≤ 1 day), **Medium** (2-5 days), **Medium-High** (1-2 weeks), **High** (2-4 weeks), **Very High** (> 1 month) |

**Task ID prefixes:** Each domain document has its own prefix letter so
IDs are stable across renumbering. **C** = Completion, **T** = Type
Inference, **D** = Diagnostics, **A** = Code Actions, **F** = LSP
Features, **S** = Signature Help, **L** = Laravel, **E** = External
Stubs, **P** = Performance, **X** = Indexing, **B** = Bug Fixes,
**N** = Inline Completion.

# Scheduled Sprints

## Sprint 4 — Refactoring toolkit

Extract Function is the #1 personal feature request and something
that was available before the switch to PHPantom. Inline Variable,
Extract Variable, and Inline Function/Method have been specifically
requested by the Neovim tester. These all share scope analysis
infrastructure, so the sprint begins by building the `ScopeCollector`
as standalone shared infrastructure. This de-risks Extract Function
and lets the other refactorings proceed independently if A2 stalls.

| #   | Item                                                       | Effort | Domain       | Doc Link                                                            |

**After Sprint 4:** The core refactoring toolkit is complete. The
two most active testers have the features they specifically asked
for. The `ScopeCollector` infrastructure also benefits D8 (undefined
variable diagnostic) in Sprint 5 and any future scope-aware features.

---

## Sprint 5 — Polish for office adoption

These items close the gaps that PHPStorm and VS Code + Intelephense
users at the office would notice. Undefined variable detection is the
single most impactful missing diagnostic (leveraging Sprint 4's
`ScopeCollector`). The two low-effort diagnostics (deprecated
rendering and unreachable code) round out the diagnostic story with
minimal cost. The null coalescing code action is independent of scope
analysis and grouped here by user-facing impact.

| #   | Item                                                             | Effort | Domain         | Doc Link                                                                                    |

**After Sprint 5:** PHPantom is ready for office colleagues. They
get undefined variable detection, unreachable code dimming, proper
deprecated strikethrough, file rename on class rename, and the null
coalescing quick-fix. Nobody switching from Intelephense (free or
premium) feels like they lost more than they gained.

---

## Sprint 6 — Type intelligence depth

Type intelligence depth is PHPantom's defining advantage. This sprint
deepens that lead with features that benefit the PHPStan enthusiast
and Laravel developer alike. File system watching eliminates the
"restart the server after composer update" friction.

| #   | Item                                                      | Effort | Domain         | Doc Link                                                                                              |

| T2  | File system watching for vendor and project changes       | Medium | Type Inference | [type-inference.md T2](todo/type-inference.md#t2-file-system-watching-for-vendor-and-project-changes) |
| T3  | Property hooks and asymmetric visibility (PHP 8.4)        | Medium | Type Inference | [type-inference.md T3](todo/type-inference.md#t3-property-hooks-php-84)                               |
| D4  | Unresolved type in PHPDoc diagnostic                      | Medium | Diagnostics    | [diagnostics.md D4](todo/diagnostics.md#d4-unresolved-type-in-phpdoc)                                 |
| E1  | GTD for built-in symbols via project-level phpstorm-stubs | Low    | External Stubs | [external-stubs.md E1](todo/external-stubs.md#e1-project-level-phpstorm-stubs-for-gtd)                |

**After Sprint 6:** PHPantom has the deepest type intelligence of
any PHP language server. `key-of`/`value-of`, property hooks, and
inherited docblock types all work. The type engine advantage is
unambiguous.

---

## Sprint 7 — Laravel excellence & stub accuracy

Facade resolution (L1) is the highest-impact Laravel item remaining
and the primary interaction pattern for Laravel developers. The rest
of the sprint focuses on stub accuracy (version-aware types, array
shapes, SPL iterators) and signature help gaps. Partial result
streaming (F2) lands here to improve perceived latency for large
projects now that the feature set is mature enough to benefit from it.

## Sprint 8 — Blade support

Blade is a multi-phase project tracked in [todo/blade.md](todo/blade.md).
Shipping Blade support makes PHPantom the first open-source PHP language
server with Blade intelligence.

| Phase   | Scope                        | Key Items                                                                                 |
| ------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Phase 1 | Blade-to-PHP preprocessor    | Module skeleton, directive translation, source map, LSP wiring                            |
| Phase 2 | Component support            | Template/component discovery, `<x-component>` parsing, `@props`/`@aware`, name completion |
| Phase 3 | Cross-file view intelligence | View name GTD, signature merging for `@extends`, component→template variable typing       |
| Phase 4 | Blade directive completion   | Directive name completion with snippet insertion                                          |
